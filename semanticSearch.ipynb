Abdel-Aal and Nejat Veziroglu\\nAbstract From the ancient times, mankind has always been aware that all life on\\nearth depends upon water, the principal ingredient of all living cells. Its importancein forming the creation in all of its aspects in general and the living creatures in\\nparticular, as well as human kind, animals, and plants, is evident to all of us. It is\\nhighly important to know that water has played a major role for human kind. When\\nthe Ionian philosopher Thales of Miletus (624–545 BC) replaced the Gods withNatural Laws as the force governing all phenomena; he made water the central\\nelement in his theory.\\nThis chapter addresses the issue that water, besides its indispensable usage by\\nhuman beings in drinking and in everyday life, is the key element in providing lifewith energy, in the form of hydrogen .\\nThe main aim of this work is to shed some light on the relationship between\\nhydrogen, water, and energy. A review of some scientiﬁc unique physical and\\npowerful properties of water is presented. The high speciﬁc heat, caused by\\nhydrogen bonding, is behind the resistance to temperature change. Its availabilityfor mankind made it the standard of the thermometric scale. Next, the work presents\\nto the community of scientists some scientiﬁc citations and quotations that supportour statement that water is the ultimate source of hydrogen energy.\\nNewton, an avid alchemist set forth in De Natura Acidorium, views that all\\nsubstances can be reduced to water. Eventually, hydrogen, one of the components of\\nwater, can be derived from it. What is most amazing is that all of these citations,\\nscientiﬁc statements, and notions had been proven to be in perfect agreement withscience and our modern-day scientiﬁc discoveries that were not known to man1,500 years ago.\\nThis understanding of the use of water in providing energy in the form of\\nhydrogen adds a new dimension to our scientiﬁc thinking that life on earth depends', metadata={'page': 449.0, 'source': 'Algae-Chatbot/978-3-319-17031-2.pdf'})"

They are classified as algae because they contain chlorophyll a and related compounds, which are characteristic of algae. Additionally, cyanobacteria share many structural features with bacteria, but their ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia and their production of nitrogenous compounds and cyclic polyethers are more similar to algae.\n",
